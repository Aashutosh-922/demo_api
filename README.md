**Node.js Application README**

This README provides instructions on how to run a Node.js application using `nodemon` from the `index.js` file.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
3. Install dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the application, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
This command will run the application using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server whenever changes are made to the `index.js` file.

### Configuration
If your application requires any configuration, make sure to update the necessary configuration files before running the application.

### Additional Information
- By default, the application will run on port 3000. You can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. If you need to change the port, you can do so by modifying the `index.js` file.
- Make sure any environment variables required by the application are properly configured before starting the server.
